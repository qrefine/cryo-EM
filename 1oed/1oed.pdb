REMARK   3 OTHER DETAILS: NO REFINEMENT WAS CARRIED OUT ON THE MODEL. THE       
REMARK   3  COORDINATES ARE PRELIMINARY. INCLUDED ARE ALL RESIDUES IN THE       
REMARK   3  TRANSMEMBRANE SEGMENTS M1-M3 AND M4, AND THE CONNECTING LINKS       
REMARK   3  M1-M2 AND M2-M3. THE EXTENDED LOOP BETWEEN M3 AND M4, FORMING       
REMARK   3  THE INTRACELLULAR DOMAIN OF THE RECEPTOR, AND SEVERAL OF THE C      
REMARK   3  -TERMINAL RESIDUES ON M4 (CHAINS B, C AND E) ARE OMITTED. THE       
REMARK   3  LINK BETWEEN M1 AND M2 WAS POORLY RESOLVED AND THE TRACE HERE       
REMARK   3  IS ALMOST CERTAINLY WRONG IN DETAIL. IT IS HOPED THAT WITH          
REMARK   3  IMPROVED DATA AND WITH REFINEMENT A MORE ACCURATE MODEL WILL        
REMARK   3  BE OBTAINED. THESE COORDINATES, INCLUDING ESTIMATES OF SIDE         
REMARK   3  CHAIN POSITIONS, ARE BEING MADE AVAILABLE IN THE HOPE THAT          
REMARK   3  THEY WILL BE USEFUL. USERS SHOULD BEAR IN MIND THAT BECAUSE OF      
REMARK   3  THE LIMITED RESOLUTION THE CONFORMATIONS OF THE SIDE CHAINS         
REMARK   3  AND THEIR ATOMIC COORDINATES ARE NOT INDIVIDUALLY RELIABLE.         
REMARK   3  ALSO THE ENDS OF THE HELICES ARE UNCERTAIN BY AT LEAST ONE          
REMARK   3  RESIDUE. THE SURFACE LATTICE OF THE TUBULAR CRYSTALS HAS P2         
REMARK   3  SYMMETRY. THE FOUR HELICAL FAMILIES, DEFINED BY THE NUMBERS OF      
REMARK   3  THE TWO PRINCIPAL HELICES REQUIRED TO FILL 360 DEGREES OF           
REMARK   3  AZIMUTH, WERE: (-16,6),(-18,6),(-17,5),(-15,7). NEGATIVE            
REMARK   3  INDICATES LEFT-HANDED. TO COMPARE AND COMBINE FOURIER TERMS         
REMARK   3  FROM WITHIN A FAMILY IT WAS USUALLY NECESSARY TO REASSIGN           
REMARK   3  LAYER-LINES TO MATCH THOSE CORRESPONDING TO A STANDARD HELICAL      
REMARK   3  SELECTION RULE DEFINING A TYPICAL SET OF POSITIONS IN THE           
REMARK   3  TRANSFORM. THE STANDARD SELECTION RULES WERE: L = 113N' + 314M      
REMARK   3  (N = 2N') (-16,6) L = 25N' + 112M (N = 6N') (-18,6) L = 247N +      
REMARK   3  605M (-17,5) L = -91N + 662M (-15,7) WHERE L IS THE LAYER-LINE      
REMARK   3  NUMBER, M IS AN INTEGER, N IS THE START NUMBER (I.E. NUMBER         
REMARK   3  AROUND THE CIRCUMFERENCE) OF THE CONTRIBUTING HELIX, AND N=2N'      
REMARK   3  INDICATES THAT THE START NUMBERS OCCUR IN MULTIPLES OF 2.

REMARK 245   IMAGING DETAILS                   : THE SPECIMENS WERE             
REMARK 245    TUBULAR CRYSTALS GROWN IN LOW SALT BUFFER FROM ISOLATED           
REMARK 245    TORPEDO POSTSYNAPTIC MEMBRANES.  THEY WERE APPLIED TO THE         
REMARK 245    THE MICROSCOPE GRIDS AND FROZEN IN THE SAME SOLUTION.             
REMARK 245    THESE CRYSTALS WERE TOO SMALL AND DISTORTED TO YIELD              
REMARK 245    MEANINGFUL ELECTRON DIFFRACTION PATTERNS, SO BOTH THE             
REMARK 245    AMPLITUDE AND THE PHASE TERMS HAD TO BE MEASURED FROM             
REMARK 245    FOURIER TRANSFORMS OF THE IMAGES. THE IMAGES WERE                 
REMARK 245    RECORDED USING A DOSE OF 2000 ELECTRONS/NM2 DURING                
REMARK 245    THE PERIOD: JAN-1996 TO OCT-2002. THE DATASETS INVOLVED           
REMARK 245    4 HELICAL FAMILIES OF TUBES, WHICH WERE ANALYSED                  
REMARK 245    (INCLUDING CORRECTIONS FOR DISTORTIONS) AS DESCRIBED              
REMARK 245    IN THE REFERENCES.  STRUCTURES WERE SYNTHESISED                   
REMARK 245    FROM THE AMPLITUDE AND PHASE TERMS DERIVED FROM EACH              
REMARK 245    HELICAL FAMILY. THE FINAL DATASET WAS OBTAINED BY                 
REMARK 245    AVERAGING THESE 4 STRUCTURES IN REAL SPACE.
